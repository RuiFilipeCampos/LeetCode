# Data Structure

Definition from wikipidedia:

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **data structure** is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

> More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure#cite_note-4) i.e., it is an [algebraic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") about [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data").

(that last phrase is pretty cool)
